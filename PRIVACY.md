# Privacy Policy for Card Estimates Power-Up

**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026

## Overview

Card Estimates is a Trello Power-Up that allows users to add numeric estimates to cards and calculate column totals. This privacy policy explains how the Power-Up handles data.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What Data We Collect

The Card Estimates Power-Up collects and stores:
- **Numeric estimate values** entered by users for individual Trello cards
- This data is stored using Trello's built-in storage API at the card level

### What Data We DO NOT Collect

We do not collect, access, or store:
- Personal information (names, email addresses, etc.)
- Card content or descriptions
- Board structure or organization
- User activity or behavior
- Any data outside of the numeric estimates you explicitly enter

## How Data is Stored

- All estimate data is stored directly in Trello's infrastructure using their official API
- Data is stored as "shared" card data, meaning it's visible to all board members who have access to the card
- No data is sent to external servers or third-party services
- No data is stored outside of Trello's ecosystem

## Data Access

- Only users with access to a specific Trello board can view the estimates on that board
- Estimates follow Trello's existing permission model
- When you remove the Power-Up from a board, all estimate data remains in Trello's storage
- You can clear individual estimates at any time using the "Clear" button in the estimate popup

This Power-Up does not:
- Send data to any third-party analytics services
- Use tracking cookies

- Integrate with external APIs (except Trello's official API)

## Data Retention
